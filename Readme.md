## Introduction

Damavand is a package to simplify rotary machines vibration-based analysis, through standardizing downloading, loading and transforming processes. The main motivation behind developing it is to democratize rotary machine intelligent predictive maintenance, through the development of an end-to-end unified data processing framework, covering from downloading the raw data to data preprocessing.

## Terminology and Lifecycle

Damavand simplifies the development of an Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) pipeline for a rich collection of benchmark rotary machines dataset; followings are the essential steps of such pipelines:

1. **Downloading the dataset**: datasets are downloadable using either custom or general *downloaders*.
2. **Mining the dataset**: *digestors* transform raw dataset files into structured pairs of signals and metadata (**mining** for short).
3. **Application of signal processing**: *signal processing tehcniques* are employed to process and enrich the signal banks, for the downstream analysis.

The image below, illustrates the lifecycle of a Damavand pipeline. As highlighted in the image, employment of Damavand makes the development of ETL pipelines highly repeatable, resulting in faster iterative trials.

It is worth mentioning that we do not regard data augmentation as an essential step of the pipeline; therefore, we have not included that in this section; complementary explanations on data augmentation using Damavand is provided late on this page.

## Anatomy

Damavand currently consists of four modules:

- **utils**: a submodule to include genral and basic functions
- **signal_processing**: implementation of the most frequently-used signal processing transforms and features used for vibration analysis
- **datasets**: this submodule consists of two parts:
    * **downloaders**: helping classes to download benchmark datasets
    * **digestors**: helping classes to process raw dataset files into structured pairs of signal banks and their corresponding metadata
- **augmentations**: implementation of a collection of data augmentation techniques, suiting vibration data

The image below, illustrates an overview of the Damavand.

In the above table, $F_s$, BIR, BOR, M, U, BBP, BIO, UHB, OHB and BCP correspond to the sampling frequency, bearing inner race fault, bearing outer race fault, misalignment, unbalance, bearing ball problem, combinatory inner and outer races fault, underhang bearing, overhang bearing and bearing cage problem.

## Installation

Currently, Damavand is accessible through the official Github repository, as below:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/amirberenji1995/damavand
```

Once the repository is cloned, install the dependencies as below:

```bash
pip install -r damavand/requirements.txt
```

## Quickstart

Once the package is installed, its whole functionality is accessible; the code snippet below, demonstrate a simple usage scenario, where a dataset is downloaded, loaded and processed.

```Python
# Importings
from damavand.damavand.datasets.downloaders import read_addresses, ZipDatasetDownloader
from damavand.damavand.datasets.digestors import UoO
import pandas as pd

# Downloading the dataset
addresses = read_addresses() # reading the addresses
downloader = ZipDatasetDownloader(addresses['UoO']) # instantiating the downloader to download the UoO dataset (https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/v43hmbwxpm/1)
downloader.download_extract('UoO.zip', 'UoO/')  # downloading and extracting the dataset

# Mining the dataset
dataset = UoO('UoO/', ['Channel_1', 'Channel_2'], [1]) # instantiating the dataset
mining_params = {'win_len': 10000, 'hop_len': 10000} # defining the mining parameters
dataset.mine(mining_params) # mining the dataset

# Aggregating the mined data over the first channel
df = pd.concat(dataset.data['Channel_1']).reset_index(drop = True)

# Signal/Metadata split
signals, metadata = df.iloc[:, : -3], df.iloc[:, -3 :] # last three columns are state, loading and repetition; therefore, they are excluded into metadata
```

## Next steps

We highly encourage our developers to help in extending the Damavand, particularly in the following directions:

1. Adding new datasets
2. Adding new signal processing methods
